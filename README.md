# TYPE NEW TAB
A dead simple new tab Chrome extension for typing and saving notes. Nothing special, but something I wanted to make for myself.

## INSTALLING
This is just a development release. Download or clone this repo as an unpacked extension.

If you downloaded the code, unzip the file.

Open (chrome://extensions/) or select the menu `Window > Extensions`.

Enable the developer mode at top right.

Click `Load unpacked extension...` and select the source code folder.
